# Deep Learning - Course 

This repository collects supplementary materials to the master's course "Deep Learning" given by [Berit Zeller-Plumhoff](https://www.cdma.uni-rostock.de/lehrstuhl/team/) - University of Rostock - [Chair of Data-driven Analysis and Design of Materials](https://www.cdma.uni-rostock.de/), Rostock, Germany. 

## Getting Started

The Jupyter notebooks are accessible in various ways

* Online as [static web pages](https://gitlab.uni-rostock.de/msf-cdma/cdma-exercise-deeplearning-public/-/blob/main/index.ipynb?ref_type=heads)
* Online for interactive usage with [binder](https://mybinder.org/)
* Local for interactive usage on your computer

Other online services (e.g. [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), ...) provide environments for interactive execution of Jupyter notebooks as well.
Local execution on your computer requires a local Jupyter/IPython installation.
The [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) can be considered as a convenient starting point.
Then, you'd have to [clone/download the notebooks from Github](https://gitlab.uni-rostock.de/msf-cdma/cdma-exercise-deeplearning.git).
Use a [Git](http://git-scm.org/) client to clone the notebooks and then start your local Jupyter server. For manual installation under OS X/Linux please refer to your packet manager.
