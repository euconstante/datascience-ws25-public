    "Following the linear regression example above, you should now implement a polynomial regression, which is is a more general case of the linear regression where features of the form $x^d \\,, d\\in \\mathbb{N}$ may be included. We will use an example that determines the radius of gyration $R_g$ for a set of small angle X-ray scattering data. The radius of gyration is the average electron density weighted square distance of scatterers from the centre of the object. It is related to the dimensions of certain well-defined shapes, such as spheres and ellipses, but different structures can exhibit the same $R_g$."
